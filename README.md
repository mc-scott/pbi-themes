# Power BI Theme Generator

A script `generate_json_theme.py` uses global variables to set a Power BI Theme by editing a JSON document.

- This project will eventually include an app so global variables can be edited with various data entry fields like drop-downs or sliders. Users will be able to see a preview of how their changes will affect the style of the theme they are building.

The foundations of this project are based on the book [Pro Power BI Theme Creation](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-9633-2) by Adam Aspin where I got most of the information about how to edit JSON theme documents. I have adapted this information into a theme generator script (and eventually application) so advanced themes can be created by end users without the nitty-gritty knowledge of JSON syntax otherwise required to do so.
